Calculator

A sleek, minimalist calculator web app inspired by the design and functionality of Apple's iOS Calculator. This project implements both basic arithmetic operations and additional features such as sign toggle and percentage calculations, wrapped in a clean, user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Responsive calculator UI styled closely to the iOS calculator design  
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Toggle sign (`±`) for the current number  
- Percentage calculation (`%`)  
- Clear (`C`) and backspace (`⌫`) functionality on the same button  
- Smooth input experience with scrolling for long expressions  
- Error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero  
- Rounded results with up to 4 decimal places for better readability  

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (flexbox, grid, custom scrollbar styling)  
- Vanilla JavaScript (no external libraries)  

## How to Use

- Click buttons or tap on a device to input numbers and operators  
- Use `C` to clear the entire input or `⌫` to delete the last character (the button toggles automatically)  
- Press `±` to toggle the sign of the last entered number  
- Press `%` to convert the last number to its percentage equivalent  
- Press `=` to evaluate the expression and display the result  
- Supports continuous calculations  

## Inspiration

This calculator is inspired by Apple's iOS calculator app's clean look and intuitive user experience, striving to replicate the feel in a web environment.
